# Color Banding

A simple D3D12 sample application that demonstrates how to use white and blue noise to dither, mitigating color banding when rendering in SDR. To learn more, see the blog post at: http://www.visualextract.com/posts/color-banding/

After building and running the code, first thing I recommend you do is load up the Nsight Graphics project file (ColorBanding.nsight-gfxproj), and capture a frame of the application running. This will provide a clear view of exactly what is happening as the application is running. [Download Nsight Graphics here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics).

## Requirements

* Windows 10 v1809, "October 2018 Update" (RS5) or later
* Windows 10 SDK v1809 (10.0.17763.0) or later. [Download it here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive), or install with the Visual Studio Installer.
* Visual Studio 2017, 2019, or VS Code

## Command Line Arguments

* `-width [integer]` specifies the width (in pixels) of the rendering window
* `-height [integer]` specifies the height (in pixels) of the rendering window
* `-vsync [0|1]` specifies whether vsync is enabled or disabled
